Time overtook me, and documentation never got written for this package.
In short, it is similar to https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-activitylog/v2/introduction
and can log messages against a Laravel model, optiaonally assigning each message to a
user.

The Spatie package didn't exist when I started this, and it probably does more than
our use-case required (and still requiress), so this package will hang around, and I
probably still will not get around to fully documenting it.
